title: Simple Computer Graphics Part 1 (Canvas)
subtitle: The first part in a short series of computer graphics introduction
---

There are tons of resources and tutorials on computer graphics, so why bother writing another? Everyone gets bogged down with explaining the
math and theory behind everything. When I look through graphics tutorials I usually just end up trying to make sense of the examples.
So that's all I'm going to give you, just mildly commented source code and a javascript editor and I'll let you figure it out
yourself.

I'll try to limit myself to not using *any* third party libraries. The tutorial will only make use of standard Javscript functionality
like canvas and all the other work will be done by the tutorial. Because I won't go into too deep an explanation, I expect readers to be
mildly familiar with programming, javascript, geometery, math etc.

Canvas
===========

To begin everything let's introduce ourselves to canvas. Here we'll draw a line from the top left of a canvas, to the bottom right. Click the Run It button
to see how it works. You can edit the code in these text boxes and run it again.
