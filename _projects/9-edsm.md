EDSM
===========
[EDSM is available on Github](https://github.com/alex-sherman/edsm) as open source software. This framework was written for a school project while completing my masters with a friend of mine, Peter Den Hartog.

Overview
---
Distributed shared memory allows distributed applications on physically separate machines to share memory regions. Extendable DSM (EDSM) is an implementation of DSM that includes some powerful management components. EDSM describes an entire distributed application development strategy in addition to providing DSM, synchronization primitives and abstractions for distributed objects.
